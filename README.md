🚴‍♀️ **SQL Case Study: Driving Growth for Emily's Bike Rental Shop!** 🚴‍♂️

I've recently completed an exciting SQL case study where I helped Emily, the owner of a bike rental shop, gather critical insights to grow her business. From understanding bike ownership by category to calculating monthly rental revenue, I utilized SQL to unlock valuable data and drive actionable decisions.

🔍 **Key business questions I solved:**
- How many bikes does the shop own by category? 🚲
- What was the rental revenue for each month? 💸
- And much more!

This project enhanced my ability to translate business needs into data-driven solutions using SQL. 💡
